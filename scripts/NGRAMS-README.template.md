# Optimized typing lessons for Monkeytype

The project aims to provide structured lessons that can help you speed up your touch-typing learning process.
All wordlists in this document can be used as a custom training sets on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).

# Instructions

I assume that you already know how to correctly touch-type each letter (if not, you can go through beginner and intermediate lessons on [typing.com](https://www.typing.com/student/lessons) or other similar website).

Lessons are designed to be executed in the order provided, as they build on top of each other, with increasing difficulty. Also, the earlier lessons give you the best boost for your overall WPM (words per minute), as they use the most popular letter combinations (n-grams).

I recommend to go through at least lessons 1-9, as they build the muscle memory for transitioning from character to character, which is a good base that will allow you to fairly comfortably switch to touch-typing in your everyday activities.

I addition to teaching n-grams, each lessons will gradually teach you new whole words, which combined allow you master 9669 words (over 90% of all Monkeytype lists up to English 10k).

How to use the training sets:

- pick a target WPM (words per minute) - a good starting point is 40 WPM (advanced users can pick higher targets),
- load the first lesson as a custom wordlist on Monkeytype (you can randomize the list - number of words equal to your target WPM or time 60 is a good option),
- if you achieve your target WPM as an average of the last 10 tests (you can check it on your [Monkeytype account page](https://monkeytype.com/account)), you can move to the next lesson.

_Tip: Ideally, you should be able to achieve your average target WPM with punctuation turned on._

_Tip: After finishing this section, I advise you to fully transition to touch-typing in your daily activities (if you haven't already). You now have a strong base to type most of the words!_

## What next?

After finishing all lessons, you can repeat the cycle with higher target WPM (+20 WPM is a reasonable increase).

You are now also fully equipped to compete on all of the regular Monkeytype wordlists up to English 10k!
